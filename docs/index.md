# Ghidralib

## Welcome to ghidralib documentation!

![](dragon1.png)

This library is an attempt to provide an unofficial **Pythonic standard library** for Ghidra.

The Ghidra scripting API, while extremely powerful, is not well suited for writing
quick one-off scripts when reverse-engineering something at 3AM. Scripts usually
end up verbose, fragile (since there's no type-checking) and with camelCaseEverywhere.

The goal of this library is to make Ghidra scripting faster, easier and... more fun.

```python
from ghidralib import *
for block in Function("main").basicblocks:
    for instr in block.instructions:
        for pcode in instr.pcode:
            args = ", ".join(map(str, pcode.inputs_simple))
            print("{:x} {} {}".format(pcode.address, pcode.mnemonic, args))
```

## Basic Usage

To use ghidralib, **just drop [this file](https://github.com/msm-code/ghidralib/blob/master/ghidralib.py) into your ghidra_scripts directory**.

for a direct download link.

* For a showcase of useful API functions, check out the
[Getting Started](./getting_started.md) section (**recommended**).
* For a few more practical examples, check out the
[examples directory](https://github.com/msm-code/ghidralib/tree/master/examples)
on Github.
* Read the autogenerated API documentation [here](./reference.md).
* Check the source code at [Github](https://github.com/msm-code/ghidralib)

A fair warning: ghidralib is still actively developed and the API may change
in the future. But this doesn't matter for your one-off scripts, does it?
Current compatibility status is documented [here](./compatibility.md).
